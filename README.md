- **React 18** - Modern UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool
- **Emotion** - Powerful CSS-in-JS styling
- **npm** - Package manager

##  Features

- ✅ Two-player gameplay (X and O)
- ✅ Winner detection with modal overlay
- ✅ Draw game detection
- ✅ Reset game functionality
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions

##  Design

Maintains the original design aesthetics with:
- Blue/purple gradient background
- Pink/magenta game squares
- Green color for Player X
- Yellow color for Player O

##  Getting Started


##  How to Play

1. Player X starts first
2. Click any empty square to place your mark
3. Players alternate turns (X and O)

5. If all squares are filled with no winner, it's a draw
6. Click "Reset Game" or "Start Game" to play again

##  Component Architecture

The game follows modern React best practices:
- **Custom hooks** for game logic separation
- **Styled components** with Emotion for scoped styling
- **Type-safe props** with TypeScript
- **Design tokens** for consistent theming
- **Modular components** for reusability

##  Key Improvements Over Original

1. **Modern Framework**: React + TypeScript instead of vanilla JS
2. **CSS-in-JS**: Emotion for scoped, dynamic styling
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
4. **Better Organization**: Modular component structure
5. **Design Tokens**: Centralized theme configuration
6. **Reusable Components**: Button, Square components can be reused
7. **Better State Management**: Custom hooks pattern
